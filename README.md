# Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict flight prices based on various features such as the airline, departure/arrival time, duration of the flight, number of stops, and more. By predicting flight prices, travelers and businesses can make better-informed decisions about when to book flights for the best deals.

## Key Features of the Project:
- **Dataset**: The project uses a publicly available flight dataset with features like airline, source, destination, and duration.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **Modeling**: Trained models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE were used to assess model performance.
- **Conclusion**: The model provides insights into optimal flight choices for cost savings.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
